# Petals Around the Roses

## The Puzzle

"Petals Around the Roses" is a classic logic puzzle also known as the "Puzzle of the Wise Men" or simply "The Secret." It's a fascinating mental challenge that has been shared among friends, in classrooms, and at gatherings for decades.

The puzzle is presented as a simple dice game with three fundamental rules:

1. The name of the game is "Petals Around the Roses."
2. The name of the game is significant.
3. The answer is always even (or zero).

Each round, five dice are rolled, and the player must determine the correct answer based solely on the dice configuration and the above rules. Once you understand the secret, you'll be able to determine the correct answer every time.

Part of the tradition of this puzzle is that those who solve it are asked not to reveal the solution to others. The joy comes from the "aha!" moment when you finally figure it out for yourself.

## The Game

This interactive implementation allows you to:
- Roll the dice to generate new patterns
- Align the dice for better observation
- Check your answer against the correct one
- Practice until you discover the secret

## History

The puzzle's origins are somewhat mysterious, but it gained popularity in the 1970s when it was reportedly played in President Richard Nixon's White House. It has since become a classic brain teaser taught in schools and shared among puzzle enthusiasts worldwide.

Bill Gates is said to have solved it instantly, while others may spend days contemplating the secret. How long will it take you?
